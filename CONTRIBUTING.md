# Contributing to Negative-Light-Media

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Negative-Light-Media! This document serves as the baseline contributing guide for our organization. Teams, sub-teams, and individual repositories may override sections of this guide as needed. Please refer to the specific contributing file in the relevant team or repository for any overridden sections. The final authority on how to contribute to each project under NLM is the development team of each project so rules may vary.

## Code of Conduct

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) to ensure a welcoming and respectful environment for all contributors. This section goes for all repositories and is overreaching any team or repository rules.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improvement, please create an issue in the appropriate repository. Each team and repository will have rules for how to apply labels. Please ask if you are not sure how to label your issue.

### Submitting Changes

Follow the steps below to submit changes.

1. **Fork the Repository:** Fork the repository you want to contribute to.
2. **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your changes.
3. **Make Your Changes:** Implement and test your changes.
4. **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message.
5. **Open a Pull Request:** Create a pull request against the main branch of the repository.

Because there are various types of projects here we do not have a single coding standard so please adhere to the specific coding standards and practices of the team or repository you are contributing to.

### Testing

When contributing code please test it out first. Provide information about any tests that you have run, including steps to fix any bug. This helps us make sure that all of our code meets our requirements and ensures that bugs are fixed.

## Review Process

Most of our repositories require a maintainer to review all code contributed. These reviews help make sure that you are abiding by the coding practices for that repository and prevent bugs, malware, or unintended features from being contributed to the codebase. It is up to each project to manage reviews and to assign reviewers.
